	  If enabled we will create a new ssh key for you, to be used to log in
	  to the systems created in kubernetes. If the file already exists we
	  won't overwrite to it, uness you enable the next option.

	  Enabling this is highly encouraged, given the security concerns of
	  old development keys lingering around for too long. Development
	  systems aren't always on the most trusted systems, and since the
	  target systems are ephemeral, if you use a key you typically use
	  to log in to more important systems you are putting that key at
	  risk. By encouraging the ssh keys to be just as ephemeral as the
	  development systems created, we we ensuring there is no leakage of
	  valuable ssh keys.

	  You are encouraged to be running haveged on your local system.
